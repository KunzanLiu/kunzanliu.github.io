Understanding of complex diseases, therapeutic effects, and biological functions requires new imaging tools with minimal biological disruption, multiplexed molecular contrast in high volumes and high resolution. I build this label-free nonlinear microscope and work on designing optics and algorithms towards faster, deeper, and more colorful imaging for multicellular dynamics.

I have the privilege of collaborating closely with biologists at MIT to explore a wide range of biological questions, spanning from fundamental research to diagnostics and therapeutic strategies. Major collaborations include:
* Prof. [Linda Griffith](https://lgglab.mit.edu/) (MIT BE), human endometrium and organoids
* Prof. [Eliezer Calo](https://www.calolab.mit.edu/) (MIT Biol), nucleolus
* Dr. [Michal Tal](https://talresearchgroup.mit.edu/) (MIT BE), bacterial infection
* Prof. [Roger Kamm](https://web.mit.edu/meche/mb/) (MIT BE), microfluidic model of blood-brain barrier
* Prof. [Fan Wang](https://www.wanglab-neuro.org/) (MIT BCS), mouse whisker pad
